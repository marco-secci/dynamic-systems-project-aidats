# Dynamic Systems Projec
Marco Secci and William Majer

# What is it about
This project was about the dynamic system describing the competition between rabbits *x* and sheeps *y* for the same resources in one given environment, with:
* a > 0 inverse of the carrying capacity of the environment for rabbits
* b > 0 coefficient of competition

# Resolution

The considered case is when a = 2 and b = 1.

To identify the equilibrium points we solved simultaneously the equations and plotted fuctions.
We calculate the *Jacobian Matrix* and evaluate at all fixed points using LaTeX display for all matrices to analysize eigenvectors.
We found isoclines which happens in the equilibria points. After verifying their coordinates we made a plot to have a visual dimostration.
